                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The home page utilizes various HTML and CSS techniques to establish its structure and design. For the HTML part, semantic tags such as header, nav, section, and footer are used to create a clear and meaningful structure. Within the header, navigation is implemented using the nav element, and an unordered list (ul) is used to create a horizontal navigation menu with list items (li) containing anchor (a) tags for the links. The hero section is defined using a section element with a class of hero, which is styled to be visually distinct and appealing.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the CSS techniques, different properties are applied to enhance the visual presentation of the page elements. The body tag is styled with properties such as font-family, margin, padding, background-color, and background-image to set the overall appearance of the page. The background-image property is particularly used to set an image as the background, ensuring it covers the whole page and is centered. The header is styled with a background-color, padding, and text-align to create a uniform look. Navigation links within the nav element are styled with properties such as text-decoration, color, font-weight, padding, and transition to make them visually appealing and interactive. The hero section and other content sections like mission and info-cards are styled with padding, background-color, and text-align properties to enhance their layout and presentation. Specific styling is applied to elements like ul, li, and a within these sections to create lists and links that are easy to read and navigate. Box-shadow and border-radius properties are used to add visual effects to elements like cards within the info-cards section.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In terms of accessibility, several approaches are employed to make the home page more inclusive. The use of semantic HTML tags, such as header, nav, section, and footer, helps screen readers interpret and navigate the page more effectively. Ensuring that navigation links and interactive elements are keyboard accessible is important for users who rely on keyboard navigation. Appropriate color contrast between text and background colors is maintained to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, using ARIA attributes like aria-label and role where necessary provides extra information to assistive technologies, making the page more accessible to users with disabilities.</p>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The table page created uses a variety of HTML and CSS techniques to achieve its structure and design. For the HTML part, the table tag is fundamental as it defines the structure of the table. This includes the rows represented by tr, headers indicated by th, and data cells marked with td. Additionally, semantic tags such as thead, tbody, and tfoot are utilized to organize the table content, making it more readable and accessible. Modal dialogs are constructed using div elements with specific IDs and classes, which are then controlled dynamically through JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the CSS techniques, various properties are applied to enhance the visual presentation of the table and other elements. Styling properties such as font-family, font-size, background-color, and border are used to modify the appearance of the table and its contents. For instance, the border-collapse: collapse; property ensures that there are no gaps between the borders of table cells, creating a cleaner look. Background images are set using the background-image property, adding a visual appeal to different elements. To ensure that the table remains user-friendly across various devices, media queries (@media) are employed to adjust the layout and styles based on screen sizes. For modal dialogs, CSS properties like display, position, and z-index are critical in controlling their appearance and behavior.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In terms of accessibility, several approaches are employed to make the table page more inclusive. The use of semantic HTML tags, such as th for headers, aids screen readers in interpreting and navigating the table. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes like aria-label and role are incorporated to provide additional information to assistive technologies. Ensuring that modal dialogs and other interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation helps users who rely on keyboards to navigate the webpage. Lastly, maintaining sufficient contrast between text and background colors is essential for enhancing readability for users with visual impairments. These measures contribute to creating a more accessible and user-friendly table page.</p>

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The content page employs a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to achieve its structure, styling, and interactivity. For the HTML part, semantic tags such as header, nav, section, and footer are used to create a clear and meaningful structure. Within the header, navigation is implemented using the nav element, and an unordered list (ul) is used to create a horizontal navigation menu with list items (li) containing anchor (a) tags for the links. The content is divided into various sections, such as hero, facts, conditions, and creatures, each defined using section elements with appropriate classes and IDs for styling and functionality.</p> 
                        <p>In terms of CSS techniques, various properties are applied to enhance the visual presentation of the page elements. The body tag is styled with properties such as font-family, margin, padding, background-color, and background-image to set the overall appearance of the page. The background-image property is used to set an image as the background, ensuring it covers the whole page and is centered. Different sections are styled with properties such as padding, background-color, text-align, and box-shadow to create a visually appealing and well-organized layout. Specific styling is applied to elements like ul, li, and a within these sections to create lists and links that are easy to read and navigate. The use of flexbox and grid layouts helps in organizing content in a responsive manner, ensuring the page looks good on various devices.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the content page. For example, event listeners are added to elements like li and img to create interactive effects. When users hover over list items in the facts section, the text color changes, and the items scale up slightly to create a visual effect. Clicking on a fact displays an alert with the fact's text. Similarly, hovering over images creates a zoom effect, making the images scale up slightly. The conditions section includes clickable list items that display alerts with additional information when clicked. In the creatures section, JavaScript is used to expand and collapse details about different creatures when the user clicks on the headings.</p>
