                <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The splash screen is designed to create an engaging first impression by incorporating a background image, custom fonts, and precise positioning of elements. The background image is applied using CSS, ensuring full coverage of the screen with the `background-size: cover;` property, which prevents distortion. Additionally, `background-position: center;` keeps the image well-balanced across different screen sizes, maintaining a professional look.  

                            To enhance the visual appeal, a custom font is imported using `@import` from Google Fonts or a local source. This font is applied to text elements through the `font-family` property, ensuring consistency with the theme of the website. Further text enhancements, such as `color`, `text-shadow`, and `letter-spacing`, are used to improve readability and make the splash screen more visually striking.  
                            
                            For layout and positioning, CSS techniques such as `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` are used to strategically place elements on the screen. Flexbox or `display: grid` may also be implemented to align content both horizontally and vertically, ensuring a well-structured and responsive design. This combination of styling and positioning results in a splash screen that effectively captures attention while maintaining functionality and accessibility across various devices.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in the splash screen is addressed through several key practices. Text readability is ensured by selecting a background image with good contrast and applying text-shadow for clarity. A legible font with appropriate sizing enhances visibility across different screens.

                            For screen readers, semantic elements like headings are structured logically, helping users navigate the page easily. Images include alt attributes to provide descriptions for visually impaired users. The design avoids relying solely on color, making it more accessible for colorblind users.
                            
                            Responsiveness is achieved using CSS media queries, ensuring content adapts to various devices. Interactive elements like buttons are keyboard-accessible, with clear focus states for easy navigation. These practices make the splash screen more inclusive for all users.</p>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The volunteer page is designed to provide users with information about volunteering opportunities while ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and ease of navigation. The page follows a structured layout, incorporating clear headings, well-organized content sections, and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

                            The design features a responsive layout, achieved using CSS Flexbox or Grid, ensuring proper content alignment across different screen sizes. A visually appealing hero section introduces the page, possibly including a background image or banner to capture attention. Headings and text are styled with appropriate font sizes and colors for readability.
                            
                            A structured content flow divides information into sections such as volunteer roles, benefits, and application steps. Lists and bullet points are used to improve readability. Internal links or anchor tags allow users to quickly navigate to specific sections, enhancing usability.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>in the voluntnteer page the scrolling is done horitontal so the accessebility is implemented correctly. </p>

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This webpage is built using semantic HTML for structure and CSS for styling and responsiveness. The navigation bar is implemented with a list inside a navigation section to ensure easy access to different pages. Headings and paragraphs are structured to maintain readability, while sections are used to group related content, improving organization.  

                            Images are placed inside a gallery layout with rounded corners for a visually appealing design. The button at the bottom allows smooth scrolling to the top, enhancing user experience. The footer contains copyright information and credits. CSS is used to style elements, including font choices, layout adjustments, and spacing, ensuring a modern and engaging look.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>In this page, accessibility is addressed through several key practices. First, proper use of semantic HTML tags, such as (header), (section), and (footer), ensures that screen readers can easily interpret and navigate the content. Each image includes (alt) text, which describes the image for visually impaired users, making it accessible to those relying on assistive technology.

                            Additionally, the navigation links are clearly labeled, providing easy access to different sections of the page for users with disabilities. The "Go to Top" button is designed to be both functional and visible, allowing users to quickly navigate back to the top of the page, which enhances usability. Lastly, clear heading hierarchies (such as (h1), (h2), and (h3)) are used to break the content into easily scannable sections, benefiting screen readers and improving the overall accessibility of the page.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation of the page, a few challenges arose. First, ensuring the layout was responsive across different screen sizes was tricky, as some elements didn't resize properly. This was resolved using CSS media queries to adjust styles for various devices. Another challenge was ensuring accessibility, particularly adding (alt) text to images. Some images lacked descriptive text, which was corrected to improve accessibility. Balancing visual design with functionality also posed difficulties, especially with rounded image borders. The solution was to ensure uniform image sizing and consistent aspect ratios. Finally, implementing smooth scrolling for the "Go to Top" button required minimal JavaScript, which was resolved with the (window.scrollTo) method. These challenges taught me the importance of early testing, prioritizing accessibility, and maintaining design consistency for better user experience.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The pages I created are compliant with the Janet regulations governing web page publication in several key areas. Janet, which provides guidelines for accessibility, usability, and security, emphasizes the importance of making web content available to all users, including those with disabilities. I applied these regulations by ensuring accessibility through alternative text for images, proper use of semantic HTML, and a clear, logical structure. The navigation is straightforward, with clearly labeled links, and the layout is responsive, which enhances the user experience on various devices.

                        For accessibility, I used descriptive (alt) attributes for images to ensure that screen readers can interpret the content. I also structured headings logically to improve readability and allow users to navigate the content easily. Additionally, the pages do not rely heavily on JavaScript, which ensures that users with disabilities or slow internet connections can still access the information without issues.
                        
                        The pages adhere to usability principles by focusing on a clean design, intuitive navigation, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. Security was also a consideration, as the page avoids any third-party scripts that could potentially compromise user safety.
                        
                        By incorporating these key elements, the pages I created align with Janet’s guidelines, ensuring accessibility and usability for all users while maintaining compliance with web standards.</p>
